Elite ERP HR built the *Elite ERP HR* app as a free application intended solely for use by company employees. This Service is provided at no cost and is designed for internal company operations only.

By using the app, you agree to the practices described below.

### **Information Collection and Use**

We do **not collect or store any personally identifiable information** through the Elite ERP HR app. All employee accounts are created and managed by the company, and users cannot register independently.

---

### **Location Information**

The Elite ERP HR app requests access to your device's location **only at the moment you attempt to mark your attendance** (check-in/check-out).

* The latitude and longitude from your device are **temporarily used** to verify whether you are within the predefined radius of your companyâ€™s location.
* This location data is **transmitted as part of the attendance request** but is **not stored** in our database or saved on your device.
* We do **not track, record, or retain** your location history.

This use of location is strictly limited to confirming physical presence for valid attendance entry.

### **Security**

We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting any data used during the attendance process. While we implement reasonable security measures, no system is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute protection.

### **Changes to This Privacy Policy**

We may update this policy as needed. Changes will be posted on this page and will take effect immediately upon posting.
